# Contributing

This project is an experiment in crowdsourcing open-source software. As such, contributions are not only welcome, but necessary for the advancement of the project.

Contributions can take any shape:
- Source code
  - Pick a function that contains a `todo!()`, replace the todo with an
    implementation. Feel free to add more `todo!()` as part of the
    implementation. There is no step too small.
  - Add tests for existing, implemented modules.
  - Fix a bug.
  - Refactor for cleanliness/readability.
  - Upgrade/replace/remove a dependency.
- Tooling
  - Create/improve the CI (compilation, tests, clippy, format).
  - Add code coverage (e.g. CodeCov).
- Documentation
  - How to use the tool.
  - Documentation for existing functions/modules.
  - Example usage.
- Issues
  - Create issues to discuss/track the development of a feature.
  - File a bug.
  - Respond to a bug report with a diagnosis of what caused the bug.
- Communication
  - Raise awareness about the project to help find contributors, on any platform (X, Reddit, newsletters, private groups, ...)


## Reminder

We're all volunteers, so be kind to each other! And since we're doing that in our free time, some
things can take a longer than expected.
